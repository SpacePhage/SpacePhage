# welcome!

My name is Ryan Mayberry and I am a GIT Full-Stack Web Development student at ASU. 
After I graduate I plan to work on personal projects and expand my knowledge of coding into other fields such as astronomy. 

Currently my main programming language is Javascript but I would like to delve deeper into learning Python. 

In my free time, I enjoy amateuer astrophotography and I have begun to dip my toes into video editing with Premiere Pro.
